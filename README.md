# OpenWrt for the Digineo AC1200 Pro

This repository contains the material needed to build the official
[OpenWrt][openwrt] firmware image for our [AC1200 Pro router][ac1200pro].

## Obtaining pre-built firmwares

**You'll find the latest firmware images on the [Github releases page][releases].**

You may also use the OpenWrt images found [here][images] (look for the
`zbt-wg3526-32M` files). Please note that these images only contain the
bare essentials, and not all device features may be available without
manually installing further packages.

## Building firmware manually

To build the firmware image, you need to meet some prerequisites.

- You'll need a Linux machine to perform the build. This can be either a
  physical or a virtual machine.
- Depending on the distribution, you may need to install some dependencies
  (tools/libraries/etc.). Refer to the [OpenWrt wiki][wiki] on how to get
  started.
- The building machine requires approx. 12-15 GB free disk space. A powerful
  CPU and lots of RAM are recommended.

### Clone this repository

If you start fresh, get a copy of this repository:

```console
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/digineo/openwrt-ac1200.git .
$ cd openwrt-ac1200
```

If you only need to fetch updates, do the following:

```console
$ cd /path/to/openwrt-1200
$ git pull
$ git submodule update --init
```

### Building the image

In the source checkout directory, run this command:

```console
$ make all
```

When it finishes, you'll find the image files in `./firmware`:

- use `openwrt-ramips-mt7621-zbt-wg3526-32M-initramfs-kernel.bin` to downgrade or perform a factory reset, and
- use `openwrt-ramips-mt7621-zbt-wg3526-32M-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin` to upgrade to a newer version

Warning: Do not use the `sysupgrade` file to perform a version downgrade.
**This is not supported.**

### Flashing the router

#### via LuCI

1. Login to your router (by default http://192.168.1.1)
2. Go to *System* â†’ *Backup/Flash firmware*.
3. Under "Flash new firmware image", select the image file.
4. Click on the "Flash image..." button.
5. Click in "Proceed".
6. Wait for the process to finish. This will take a few minutes.

#### via SSH

Alternatively, you may copy the image file via `scp` onto your device, and
perform a manual sysupgrade:

```console
$ scp /path/to/kernel-or-sysupgrade.bin root@192.168.1.1:/tmp/
$ ssh root@192.168.1.1
# sysupgrade /tmp/kernel-or-sysupgrade.bin
```

This will additionally print some diagnostics, before finally restarting
the device. Do not terminate the SSH connection while sysupgrade is running!
